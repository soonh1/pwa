## How to run the app
1. Either a git client or downlaod the app and open the folder in the cli
2. Install all dependencies using the `npm install` command
3. Start the web server using the `npm run dev` command. The app will be served at http://localhost:3000/
4. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and get started

## How to use the RTE
There are three main UI components consisting of shortcutPanel, blockMenu, hoverMenu and input searching.
1. The shortcutPanel is placed on right side and gives an overview of all the shortcuts included in the RTE, and can be applied to text
2. The blockMenu is accessed by using the command ctrl + k, and the purpose of this is to build building blocks.
3. The hoverMenu is accessed when selecting / highlighting some text for styling, and includes the typical features on a RTE.

## Features

### getCommands
```
export interface EditorCommand {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  aliases: string[];
  keyboardShortcut: string[]
  command(): void
  icon: string;
  tags: string[];
}
``` 

**aliases** is a list of alternative names to commands, which makes the searching better. For example can bold have the alias heavy, when doing a search for heavy bold will appear.

**KeyboardShortcut** is an array of buttons that form a shortcut

**Command()** is a function which calls a specific editor command

**tags** is used to filter a list of **commands** based on which menu should display them.

### searchCommands
```
export const searchCommands = (
  search: string,
  tag?: string
): EditorCommand[] => {
  const filtered = getCommands().filter(
    x =>
      (x.name.toLocaleLowerCase().includes(search) ||
        x.aliases.some(y => y.includes(search))) &&
      (tag ? x.tags.some(z => z.includes(tag)) : true)
  );

  return filtered;
};
```
